Letter Variations in First Names
====

Retrieve all first names and cluster them. Derive a substitution matrix for common letter variations.A substitution matrix is a matrix that describes the rate at which a letter is replaced with anotherletter (e.g. d-t,p-b, etc.).


Disclamer: This is a relativley dumb implementation.

How to run:
```
gcc run.c
./a.out
```
